Convert text to lowercase – This is to avoid distinguish between words simply on case.

Remove Number – Numbers may or may not be relevant to our analyses. Usually it does not carry any importance in sentiment analysis

Remove Punctuation – Punctuation can provide grammatical context which supports understanding. For bag of words based sentiment analysis punctuation does not add value.

Remove English stop words – Stop words are common words found in a language. Words like for, of, are etc are common stop words.

Remove Own stop words(if required) – Along with English stop words, we could instead or in addition remove our own stop words. The choice of own stop word might depend on the domain of discourse, and might not become apparent until we’ve done some analysis.

Strip white space – Eliminate extra white spaces.

Stemming – Transforms to root word. Stemming uses an algorithm that removes common word endings for English words, such as “es”, “ed” and “’s”. For example i.e., 1) “computer” & “computers” become “comput”

Lemmatisation – transform to dictionary base form i.e., “produce” & “produced” become “produce”

Sparse terms – We are often not interested in infrequent terms in our documents. Such “sparse” terms should be removed from the document term matrix





Must Do:
Noise removal
Lowercasing (can be task dependent in some cases)
Should Do:
Simple normalization — (e.g. standardize near identical words)
Task Dependent:
Advanced normalization (e.g. addressing out-of-vocabulary words)
Stop-word removal
Stemming / lemmatization
Text enrichment / augmentation
