Notation:

    FC = Fully connected (dense) layer
    EO = Encoder output
    H = hidden state
    X = input to the decoder


Pseude-code:

 1   score = FC(tanh(FC(EO) + FC(H)))
 2   attention weights = softmax(score, axis = 1)
 3   context vector = sum(attention weights * EO, axis = 1)
 4   embedding output = The input to the decoder X is passed through an embedding layer.
 5   merged vector = concat(embedding output, context vector)
 6   This merged vector is then given to the GRU
